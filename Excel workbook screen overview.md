| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title Bar**                  | Located at the very top of the window, this bar displays the name of the current workbook (e.g., "Book1 - Excel" or "SalesReport.xlsx") and includes the standard window controls (Minimize, Maximize, Close).                                                                                      |
| **Quick Access Toolbar (QAT)** | A customizable toolbar usually located near the Title Bar. It contains shortcuts to frequently used commands, such as Save, Undo, and Redo, which are always accessible regardless of which Ribbon tab is selected.                                                                                 |
| **Ribbon**                     | A command bar that organizes the application's features into a series of tabs (e.g., Home, Insert, Page Layout, Formulas, Data, Review, View). Each tab contains groups of related commands and tools presented as buttons and menus. This is where you access nearly all of Excel's functionality. |
| **Name Box**                   | Located just to the left of the Formula Bar. It displays the address or name of the currently selected cell (e.g., "A1", "C5"). It can also be used to quickly navigate to a specific cell by typing its address or to define a name for a cell range.                                              |
| **Formula Bar**                | A long input bar located below the Ribbon. It displays the data or formula contained within the active cell. You can enter or edit data directly in the cell itself or use this bar for more complex input, especially when dealing with long formulas.                                             |
| **Column Headings**            | The letters (A, B, C, ...) that run horizontally across the top of the worksheet grid. Clicking a heading selects the entire vertical column.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Row Headings**               | The numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) that run vertically down the left side of the worksheet grid. Clicking a heading selects the entire horizontal row.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Active Cell**                | The currently selected cell, indicated by a thick green border. This is where any data you type will appear.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Worksheet Area (Grid)**      | The main working area consisting of thousands of cells organized in rows and columns. This is where you input your data, create formulas, and view your results.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Sheet Tabs**                 | Located at the bottom of the worksheet area. Each tab represents a single worksheet within the workbook (e.g., "Sheet1", "Sheet2"). You can click these tabs to switch between sheets, add new sheets, and rename them.                                                                             |
| **Status Bar**                 | The horizontal bar at the very bottom of the Excel window. It provides information about the current state of the program (e.g., "Ready", "Saving"). It also dynamically displays statistical summaries (like Average, Count, Sum) of any selected range of numbers.                                |
| **View Buttons**               | Located on the right side of the Status Bar, these buttons allow you to quickly switch between different workbook views: Normal, Page Layout, and Page Break Preview.                                                                                                                               |
| **Zoom Slider**                | Located next to the View buttons, this slider allows you to zoom in or out of the worksheet area for better visibility.                                                                                                                                                                             |
